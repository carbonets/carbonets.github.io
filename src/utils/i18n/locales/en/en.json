    "prototypeDescription": "Our first prototype is a Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) unit that captures carbon just like a tree, but at rates unforeseen by trees and indefinitely. The carbon is then stored or used in various ways.",

The scientific club is very happy to have his support in the laboratory, in terms of theory, in terms of training and especially on a moral level. ÉTS is not recognized for chemistry, but we would like to change that.",

    "subtitleDACC": "DIRECT AIR CARBON CAPTURE",
    "paragraphDACC": "Carbon can be captured in multiple ways and creating a <1>DACC</1> unit is a great place to start. The unit captures carbon <3>just like a tree</3>, but unlike a tree which reaches a limit when it finishes growing, the DACC can continue to capture and do so at rates unforeseen by trees.",
    "subtitleKeyElement": "The Key Element",
    "paragraphKeyElement": "The <1>sorbent</1>, also known as the absorbing material, is created from a high-temperature resistant honeycomb style monolith containing <3>CO₂</3> absorbing molecules such as <5>amines</5>.",
    "subtitleDesorptionProcess": "The Desorption Process",
    "paragraphDesorptionProcess": "Once the sorbent starts to slow down its rate of capture meaning that the sorbent is reaching saturation, it is time to inject <1>energy</1> in some form in order to <3>break the bonds</3> and capture the CO₂.",
    "subtitleAirflow": "Airflow Optimization",
    "paragraphAirflow": "Due to an extremely low percentage of CO₂ in the atmosphere of approximately <1>0.04%</1>, airflow to the sorbent is key and optimization of <3>energy efficiency and speed</3> to get the sorbent close to saturation is one of our main goals.",
    "subtitleSensors": "Reliable Sensors",
    "paragraphSensors": "CO₂ sensors are hard to find at low price and the cheaper ones are unreliable because of factors such as <1>inconsistent airflow</1> to the sensing area and <3>calibration complexity</3>. They are key to understanding how much carbon has been captured. A <5>custom sensor package</5> needs to be implemented.",
    "subtitleEnergy": "Clean Energy",
    "paragraphEnergy": "Ideally, power outlets do not need to be installed and the DACC can run anywhere with <1>solar power and battery backup</1>, for example. Creating the DACC with this consideration in mind ensures that the energy source is clean <3>independent of installation location</3>.",
    "subtitleCO2": "What do we do with the CO₂?",
    "paragraphCO2": "Although the main challenge for this prototype is to gather the carbon there are many ways to use carbon such as <1>3D printed filament</1>, using it to help <3>plant life</3> or simply <5>hiding it away</5> making sure it never rises to the surface again.",
